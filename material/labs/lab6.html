<h1>Lab 6: Controlling external devices - motors</h1>

<P>
<h2>Goals:</h2>

<P>
The major goal is to interface the AVR to an external device, and have the AVR
act as a controller for that device. The lab will use motors as the
external devices.

<P>
In particular, it will interfacing the AVR to a L293D,
to control a DC motor.
It will use the same device, with different control code, to
control a stepping motor.

<!--
<h2> Laboratory Report Submission Details </h2>
<p>
A laboratory report briefly describing what was done in the lab,
including any relevant observations, and giving the responses to
the questions in the laboratory description.

<P>
Any code written should also be provided, and demonstrated to the
lab instructor before it is submitted.

<P>
The lab report is expected at the end of the lab period.

<h2> Motor control </h2>

<P>
Controlling real-world devices is perhaps the largest application for
embedded processing. The capability to perform complex control algorithms,
possibly adapting to different environments, is a key application
for such systems.

<P>
We will look at controlling two different types of motors commonly found in
small and large control applications.

<h2> Driving a simple DC gear motor with the L293D </h2>

<p>
The L293D is a half H-bridge driver for DC electric motors.
They can provide bi-directional control, and isolate the
motor power supply from the logic driver (the microprocessor,
in our case.)
They are often used with pulse width modulation.

<P>
Following is the pinout for the L293D:

<p>

<P>
Construct the circuit depicted in the following diagram.
Note that only output 1 and 2 are connected to the motor.
Pin 8 is connected to the target power supply for the motor
(a battery pack, in our case.) Pin 16 is connected to the logic
power supply (the SDK-500, in our case.)

<p>
<center><img src="lab6_files/motor-ckt1.jpg"></center>

<P>
The speed of the DC motor can be controlled with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).
Write and test a program that accepts commands from a user that controls
the motor's direction and the duty cycle of the PWM.
The program should accept a line from the USART (terminated by a '<code>\n</code>').
The first character should be either an 'f' for forward or 'b' for backward.
An integer specifying the duty cycle from 0 to 255 should follow
the 'f' or 'b'.

<P>
A duty cycle of 100 percent is specified with 255.
The <TT>OC2B</TT> (PWM output) is connected to the <TT>enable1,2</TT> line
on the L293D.

<P>
Your program should be constructed with a main routine that accepts user
commands via the USART.
If the first character is a 'f', then "Input 1" should be 1 and
"Input 2" should be 0.
If the character was a 'b', then "Input 1" should be 0 and "Input 2" should
be 1.
The following integer should set the duty cycle.

<P>
Test the performance of the motor for a reasonable set of input commands,
and note the results.

<h3> Optional:</h3>

<P>
Add the required connections to drive a second motor using the same timer
and L293D controller. The second motor speed and direction should be
controlled independently of the first motor. This is a technique often used
steer mobile wheeled robots.


<h2> Driving a bipolar stepping motor with the L293D </h2>
<p>
Connect the stepping motor as indicated in the following diagram.
Note that only the motor connections change from the first section.

<p>
<center><img src="lab6_files/motor-ckt2.jpg"></center>

<P>
Using the program in the first section as a base, modify the program to
accept as input a line from the USART containing a direction and a time period.
The direction is indicated by the character 'f' or 'b', the time period
by an integer.
The integer determines the number of milliseconds between changes to the
stepping motor control.
A value of 10 would mean that the stepping motor would perform a step
every 10 milliseconds.
Configure timer 0 to interrupt the microcontroller every 1&nbsp;mS.

<p>
A data sheet for the stepping motor is available
<a href="http://www.cs.mun.ca/~paul/cs4723/material/labs/lab6_files/airpax_lb82273.pdf"> here</a>.

<P>
The stepping motor should be programmed to perform full and half steps
all together (e.g., the motor will go from a full step to half step position,
and then to the next full step position).
Every time the specified period has occurred, the software will change
the L293D to cause the next step (see the class notes).

<P>
For the motor used in the lab, the red--gray wire pair are terminals for one
coil, and the yellow--black pair for the other coil.

<P>
The sequence for full step mode is:

</TABLE><BR>

<P>
The timers need not be used to generate the steps for the motor; this
can be done under program control by setting the appropriate bits in PORTD.

<P>
Test the performance of the motor for a reasonable set of input commands,
and note the results. In particular, note what happens when the direction
is changed.
