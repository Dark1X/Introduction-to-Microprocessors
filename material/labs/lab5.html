<h1>Lab 5: Asynchronous communication - the USART</h1>

<P>
<h2>Goals:</h2>

<P>
The main goal of this lab is to become familiar with the USART port,
and with asynchronous data communication. The C standard I/O functions
will also be used.

<!--
<h2> Laboratory Report Submission Details </h2>
<p>
A laboratory report briefly describing what was done in the lab,
including any relevant observations, and giving the responses to
the questions in the laboratory description.

<P>
Any code written should also be provided, and demonstrated to the
lab instructor before it is submitted.

<P>
The lab report is expected at the end of the lab period.

<h2> Asynchronous communication - USART </h2>

<P>
The USART, particularly in asynchronous mode, is a common interface
to peripheral devices.
It uses a small number of pins, and can maintain a reasonable data
transfer rate.
Its most popular communication interface, the RS232 port, is the
classical interface to terminal devices, dating back to the
teletype terminals.


<h2> Communication between an RS232 port and the the SPI port </h2>

<p>
In this lab, you will input characters through the RS232 port of the STK-500
display the character on the LEDs, and output the character through the
SPI port.

<P>
The value returned from the SPI input will be echoed back to the terminal
through the RS232 port.

<P>
The function can be tested by connecting the output (the <TT>MOSI</TT> pin)
to the input (the <TT>MISO</TT> pin) and displaying the output on the LEDs.

<P>
The STK500 has a RS232 driver built into the board. Recall that the RS232
standard requires positive and negative voltages (3 to 15 volts,
and -15 to -3 volts) for 0 and 1 respectively.

<P>
The two pins  labeled <TT>RXD</TT> and <TT>TXD</TT> at <TT>RS232 SPARE</TT>
(between LEDs 4 and 5) can be used to connect to the RS232 driver.
They can be connected directly to the USART pins <TT>RXD0</TT> and <TT>TXD0</TT>
directly (pins <TT>PD0</TT> and <TT>PD1</TT>).

<P>
In order to exercise this program, there needs to be a terminal connected
to the device, configured to run at 9600 baud.
You can use <TT> putty</TT>, <TT >Hyperterminal</TT>,
or any other terminal emulator for this.

<P>
The code supplied in class sets up the terminal output as <TT>stdin</TT>
and the terminal input as <TT>stdout</TT>.
Try configuring the terminal input as <TT>stderr</TT>.

<h2> Configuring a shift register (74HC595) as a SPI slave </h2>

<P>
We will add a shift register and LED array to display the value output
from the SPI port. The pin configuration for the 74HC595 shift register
is in the following figure:

<p>

<P>
To use it as an SPI device, we need to
determine the connections for <TT>MOSI</TT>, <TT>MISO</TT>, <TT>SCK</TT>,
and the device select <TT>SS</TT>.

<P>
From the data sheet, the pin <TT>RCK</TT> enables transfer of the input to
the output on its rising edge, so we can use it as SS.
Serial input (<TT>SER</TT>) can be connected to <TT>MOSI</TT>.
Serial output (<TT> Q'<sub>H</sub></TT>) can be connected to <TT>MISO</TT>.
The clock input (<TT>SCK</TT>) is connected to <TT>SCK</TT> from the SPI port.

<P>
There are two other inputs, <TT>SCLR</TT>, and <TT>G</TT>.
The <TT>G</TT> input is a kind of ``device select'' which enables the outputs
when it is set low, so we can tie it to ground.
The <TT>SCLR</TT> input clears the shift register when it is set low, so
we can tie it high.

<P>
The outputs can then be connected to the LED array through a resistor array,
as for the 7 segment display.

<P>
What is the output on the terminal in this configuration? Explain.

<P>
Try configuring the SPI port as <TT>stdout</TT>, with the terminal
as <TT>stdin</TT> and <TT>stderr</TT>.
Is this a good configuration for this example? Why or why not?

<p>
<h3>Optional:</h3>

<p>
Replace the SPI port with the second serial port, in SPI mode.
Describe in detail the configuration (settings of the register values)
required for this.
