<h1>Lab 0: Introduction to the laboratory equipment</h1>

<P>
<h2>Goals:</h2>

<P>
The main goal of this lab is to become familiar with the main equipment
that will be used in subsequent labs.

<h2>The STK-500</h2>

<P>
This is the primary tool for programming the Atmel processors we will be
using in the subsequent labs. It also contains several other components
which may allow us to test parts of our programs.
Generally, we will use the STK-500 as a simple development platform.

<P>
The STK-500 is powered from a 9 - 15V DC supply capable of providing at
least 0.5 amps of current.
(We will use 12V DC power supplies capable of supplying about 1 amp.)
There is a power (on/off) switch near the power supply connector.

<P>
There are two 9-pin RS-232 connectors on the board. the one closest to the
power connector, labeled <TT>RS232 CTRL</TT>, is the connection used to
communicate with the STK-500.

<P>
Turn on the power switch, and
connect a led input to one of the VTG pins. What happens? 

<P>
Connect a led input to one of the GND pins. What happens? 

<P>
Power down the STK-500, then connect the SWITCH bank to the LED bank
using one of the 10-wire cable connectors.
Then turn the power back on.
(We normally power down the STK-500 whenever we make connections to it).
What happens when a switch is pressed?

<P>
Power down the STK-500 and
connect the RS-232 cable between the processor and the STK-500
(to <TT>RS232 CTRL</TT>).

<P>
In Linux, the program <TT>avrdude</TT> can be used to actually program the
processor in the STK-500, and also determine the state of the programmer.
The latter is what we do next.

<P>
Execute the command:

<P>
<TT>avrdude -P /dev/ttyS0 -t -p m1284p -c stk500v2</TT>

<P>

<P>
Then type the following commands:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>help
</LI>
<LI>part
</LI>
<LI>sig
</LI>
<LI>dump lfuse
</LI>
<LI>dump hfuse
</LI>
<LI>dump efuse
</LI>
<LI>parms
</LI>
<LI>quit
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Ensure that you understand the outputs.
In particular, what do the fuse settings mean?
Refer to the data sheet for the ATmega1284p to determine these.

<P>
What is the target voltage for the device? Measure VTG using the
multimeter to confirm this value.
(Set the multimeter to the 20V range.
Then touch the + lead (red) to VTG, - lead (black) to GND.)

<P>
In Windows, the AVR Studio 4 environment provides a menu for displaying the
fuse and other configurational settings.

<P>
Next we will compile and run a simple assembler program.
the program simply copies the input at port D to output at port C.

<h2>Programming a chip </h2>

<P>
Now we will actually write a program into the memory of the ATMega1284p processor
on the STK-500 board.

<P>
The program is the same as in the class notes, and can be downloaded from
the lab home page or
<a href="http://www.cs.mun.ca/~paul/cs4723/material/labs/lab0_files/copyd-c.S"> here</a>.

<P>
After the program is compiled, it can be loaded by the avrdude program.
Instructions for compiling the program are included as comments near
the top of the program file.
The STK can be programmed using 

<P>
<code> avrdude -P /dev/ttyS0  -p m1284p -c stk500v2 -U flash:w:app.hex </code>

<P>
(here, <TT>app</TT> is the name of the program).

<P>
In Windows, it  can be programmed through the AVR Studio 4 environment.

<P>
After programming the device, turn off the power and connect one of the 10 pin
cables between the switch and port D, and the the other between the LEDs
and port C.
(Show this to the instructor before turning the power back on.)

<P>
Then power up the device, and observe what happens when you press one
or more buttons.


<h2>Another program</h2>

<P>
This is the second program from class, and it uses a single pin from port B
(Pin B4) as input, and outputs a sequence of 0 1 0 1 ... with a period
determined by the program code to Port B5 as long as the button is pressed.

<P>
This program can also be downloaded from the home page, or 
<a href="http://www.cs.mun.ca/~paul/cs4723/material/labs/lab0_files/beep.S"> here</a>.

<P>
It can be assembled and downloaded to the STK-500 similarly.

<P>
For this example, use the wire connectors to connect a switch to pin B4,
and connect a small speaker between pin B5 and ground. This can conveniently
be done using Expansion Connector 1 on the STK-500. (Insert the speaker
pins in socket positions 21 and 25 - see the example board in the lab).
<p>

<P>
Connect an oscilloscope probe to the output pin (pin B5) to see the shape
of the waveform generated.

<P>
Modify the frequency of the code (changing the loop variables, for example)
and observe the different frequencies.

<P>
This same method can be used to vary the intensity of and LED, for example,
or even to play music. (We will find more efficient ways to do this later.)

<P>
<H3> Optional: </H3>

<P>
Modify the assembly language program so the sound frequency varies
continuously while the button is pressed.
